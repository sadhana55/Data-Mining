Dataset and Sample Code
Task is to classify NBA players into 5 positions on the basketball court: SG (shooting guard), PG (point guard), 
SF (small forward), PF (power forward), and C (center). 

You make the classification based on the players' per-game average performance in the 2015-2016 season. 
The dataset is in a CSV file "NBAstats.csv" that is provided to you. 

For loading CSV file and processing the data, we use pandas

In the program above, we use 75% of the data for training and the rest for testing. 

Note that we are not setting random_state to a fixed value, since this is "production code". 
We built a k nearest neighbor classifier. Also note that we used two more parameters: metric for designating the distance function 
and p is the exponent in the Minkowski distance function. We used p=1 which means we used the Manhattan distance.

To make it easier to understand the constructed classification model, 
we save the training set into a CSV file and the test set together with the predicted labels into another CSV file. 
==================================================================================================================================
Tasks are as follows. 
1) Use one classification method on the dataset. 
2) Print out the accuracy of the model in 1).
3) Print out the confusion matrix for the model in 1). Note that we are dealing with a multi-class (5 basketball positions) 
classification problem. So the confusion matrix should be 5 x 5. 

4) Use the same model with the same parameters you have chosen in 1). 
However, instead of using 75%/25% train/test split, apply 10-fold stratified cross-validation.

5) Print out the accuracy of each fold in 4).
6) Print out the average accuracy across all the folds in 4).
